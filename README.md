# Developer Environment & Setup Guides

***This repository is part of my personal portfolio. All content is intended to illustrate my documentation and technical skills and provide context for other projects' repositories I maintain. It is not fully functional software and should not be used as an out-of-the-box setup.***

## Overview
This repository collects setup guides and documentation I authored or extended based on my work and personal experience. The guides are organized to help understand and reproduce development environments, but are primarily intended as **reference material for my portfolio**. They complement portfolio code by showing **environment setup, tool usage, and documentation practices**.
